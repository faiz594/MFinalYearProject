# This is my final year project. This can solve the problem of communication between an institution and its Alumni (graduates) after leaving the institution.
My project aims to connect the alumni with its institution. This can be done by alumni signup by giving credentials and after that they can login and update its acedamic details like its jobs.
Using this plateform admin can upload events, jobs that an alumni can interact and join. Admin can also create personalize email to all alumni.
